### Features

- a standalone component with minimal dependencies
- minimal CSS styling that matches the beautiful [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) forms design
- the select options can be retrieved via ajax calls or, given directly, via a parameter
- when getting the data via ajax, the component can take various parameters for results filtering
- for the back-end, the package comes with a trait for easy retrieval and formatting of the data 
as expected by the VueJS component
- can filter the option list dynamically even based on the model’s one-to-many / many-to-many relationships
- can search in multiple attributes of a model
- can specify the attribute used as label for the select options
- can be used to create a new 'tag' if no suitable result is found (soon)
- can use the arrow keys to navigate the list of results and Enter to select/deselect 
- is as small as can be, without skimping on features

### Usage

The VueJS component is already included in the Enso install and should not require any additional installation steps

1. Use the `OptionsBuilder` trait in your desired Controller

2. Define an `options` route for your Controller (and permissions as required)

3. Declare inside your controller the `$model` property as shown below:
	
	`protected $model = Model::class`
	
	where `Model::class` will be the Model used by the builder to extract the list of options
	
	You can use model computed attributes to display attributes when using the server-side mode, 
    since the entire model is sent back to the front-end.
	
	By default, the VueJS component will use the model’s `name` attribute as a label for the select option list - but this is customizable - and the `id` for the key. 
	See the options bellow for details. 
	
5. In your page/component add:

    ```
    <vue-select 
        v-model=myVariable
        source="/pathForSelectOptionsRoute" multiple
        :params="params"
        :pivot-params="pivotParams"        
        :custom-params="customParams">
    </vue-select>
    ```



### Options

#### VueSelect VueJS component options 

In order to work, the component needs a data source. The data source can be a path for server-side, OR a formatted object. 
Either a `source` or an `options` parameter is required.

- `source` - string, path to use when getting the select options **only for server-side**. | default `null`
- `options` - array of objects, list of options, **only where you don't need server-side** | default `[]`
- `trackBy` - string, the name of the option object attribute when selecting it (html `<option>` value equivalent) | default `id` |  (optional)
- `label` - string, the name of the option object attribute used as label (html `<option>` text equivalent) | default `name` |  (optional)
- `v-model` - variable holding the selected option(s). Can be a single value or an Array if the select is used as a multi-select. 
If not null/empty, the vue select will pre-populate the selected value(s) | default `[]` or `null` |  (optional)
- `disabled` - boolean, flag that sets the element as disabled | default `false` | (optional)
- `multiple` - boolean, flag that makes the element work as a multiselect, if omitted, the select acts as single select | default `false` | (optional)
- `i18n`, optional, function, that is used for translating labels, headers, and table data 
The default value (function) for this parameter simply returns its argument as the translated value
- `taggable` - boolean, flag the allows the creation of new tags (soon) | default `false` | (optional)
- `hasError` - boolean, flag sets an error styling for the select, like when validation fails | default `false` | (optional)
- `optionsLimit` - number, parameter that limits the number of options loaded from the backend | default `100` | (optional)
- `params` - object, attributes from the same table/model used for filtering results in server-side mode. 
Format: `params: { 'fieldName': fieldValue }` | default `null` | (optional)
- `pivotParams` - object, attributes from linked tables/models used for filtering results in server-side mode. 
Format: `pivotParams: { 'table': {'attribute':value} }` | default `null` | (optional)

    Note that the value may also be an array, in which case, unde the hood, a `where in` type of query will be used. 

- `customParams` - object, can be anything. 
Using customParams implies that you rewrite the 'options' method from the OptionBuilder Trait. | (optional)
- `placeholder` - custom placeholder when no option is selected | default 'Please choose' | (optional)
- `labels` - object, the labels used inside the component | default `{ selected: 'selected', select: 'select', deselect: 'deselect', noOptions: 'No options available', noResult: 'No search results found' }` | (optional)
- `debounce` - number, the number of miliseconds to use when debouncing the search on type | default `300` ms | (optional)


#### VueSelectFilter component options 
Takes the following parameters:	
- `title` - string, the title to display above the options | default `null` | (optional)	
- `value` -  the selected value from the list of options | default null | required	
	
Since this component is a wrapper for `VueSelect`, and all listeners and attributes are passed-through,	
the regular `VueSelect` options are available

#### OptionBuilder trait options

- `$queryAttributes`, array with the list of attributes we're searching in, when getting the select options | default `['name']` | (optional)
- `$model`, string, the fully qualified namespace of the class that we're querying on, in order to get the select options | default `null` | required
- `query()`, a method the will return the query builder that we're using when querying for options | default `null` | (optional)

Note: If a query method is provided, it's going to be used, if it's not given, a query will be constructed, using the given class and other values.

### Publishes

- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=select-assets` - the main VueJS components and their dependencies
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-assets` - a common alias for when wanting to update the VueJS assets,
once a newer version is released, can be used with the `--force` flag

### Notes

We've tried to make it as light as possible and use the minimum amount of external libraries and dependencies.
Therefore, the package depends just on:
 - [v-click-outside](https://github.com/ndelvalle/v-click-outside) for closing the dropdown when clicking outside clicks 
 - [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for debouncing using a selective import
 - [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons, using selective imports


When using within [Laravel Enso](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso), 
you can have the server-side route permissions generated automatically, 
when creating permissions for a resource controller, from the System/permissions menu.

You can also quickly generate permissions using the [StructureManager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/StructureManager)'s StructureMigration class.

The [Laravel Enso Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Core) package comes with this package included.
